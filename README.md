# Custom FoV

Custom FoV is a mod that allows players to customize various field of view settings through the Video Settings and
Accessibility Settings in the Options menu. The current settings allow configuration for flying, aiming, underwater and
speed-related field of view changes. The speed-related field of view changes can further be broken down into sprinting
and potion effect-related changes.

This mod is **client-side only**.

## Features

### FoV Effect Mode

Allows either all field of view changes, only vanilla field of view changes, only modded field of view changes, or no field of view changes at all.

### FoV Effect Scaling

Allows scaling different field of view changes (speed, sprinting, aiming, flying, submerged) from 0% to 100%. These settings
stack with the vanilla "FOV Effects" setting, which controls the scaling for all changes.
